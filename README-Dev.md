# Final Fantasy Randomizer: HMS Jayne Prototype
Development guide

The directories/packages in the project are:

- asp: (Answer Set Programming) These are the files that support the solver used for key item placement.
    
- data: IPS patches, and source that could be used to rebuild them in many cases.

- doslib: Dawn of Souls library - Code to support reading and writing the ROM and associated data structures.

    Contained within "doslib" is a subpackage "gen". These files are autogenerated by `build_types.py` in
    "doslib".

- ffr: Final Fantasy Randomizer - Code to support randomizing the ROM.

- labels: Text files that include NPC and location ID strings.

- stream: library to support reading and writing of streams, used by `doslib`.


## Example of how to modify something, given a data type.

```python
enemy_stats_stream = rom.open_bytestream(0x1DE044, 194 * 32)
new_enemy_stats_stream = Output()
for index in range(0, 194):
    enemy = EnemyStats(enemy_stats_stream)
    enemy.max_hp = int(enemy.max_hp * 0.1)
    enemy.write(new_enemy_stats_stream)

rom = rom.apply_patch(0x1DE044, new_enemy_stats_stream.get_buffer())
```

More details coming soon(er or later).
