0x24: Thanks for saving me! Has the oxyale\nhelped you out?\n\nIt\u8166ll never run out of air, so you can\nuse it to stay underwater as long as\nyou like!\x00
0x25: I wanted to save the mermaids living on\nthe seafloor, so I made this submarine\nout of a barrel.\nBut when I went underwater, I started\nrunning out of air, and I couldn\u8166t\nbreathe.\nIt\u8166s totally useless. Even worse, it\u8166s\ndangerous. You\u8166d better keep away.\x00

0x4c: Kee! Kee!\x00
0x4d: The curse of the Fiends changed us\ninto this form and prevented us from\nspeaking.\nThe light of the crystals has enabled\nus to speak again!\x00
0x4e: The power the four Fiends were\nabsorbing from the Crystals was being\nfed into the past by the Black Crystal.\nThe one distorting the beautiful light\nof the Crystals is the one we\u8166ve been\nlooking for all along.\nThe true root of all evil lies just\nahead...\x00
0x4f: Shine the light of the four crystals on\nthe Black Crystal in the center of the\nchamber!\nDoing so will open a time portal to this\nshrine as it existed two thousand years\nago.\x00
0x50: The light...the light of the four we\u8166ve\nbeen seeking all this time!\n\nThat light will open the time portal!\n\n\nThe portal will transport you two\nthousand years into the past to the\nbeginning of the time loop.\x00
0x51: We are Sky People. We came to this\nshrine in our attempt to locate the\nsource of the world\u8166s ruin.\nThat was four hundred years ago...\x00
0x52: Because of you, we needn\u8166t fear the\npirates anymore!\n\nThank you so much!\x00
0x53: I fled here from Melmond, a town far to\nthe west.\n\nIt is a truly pitiable sight... The earth\nrots, and monsters attack in the night.\n\nIs there nothing you can do to help?\x00
0x54: They say there are elves living across\nthe sea!\n\nBut the elf prince has fallen into a\ndeep sleep and hasn\u8166t woken up...\x00
0x55: Those blasted pirates! They\u8166re running\naround looting and pillaging like they\nown the place!\x00
0x56: I don\u8166t think there are any ports to the\nnorth. A ship can only make landfall at\na port, you know.\x00

0x59: Astos\u8166s curse has put our prince into\na deep sleep from which he cannot\nawake.\nPlease, will you not attempt to aid our\nslumbering prince?\x00

0x5c: The dark elf king, Astos, stole into the\ncastle and placed a curse on our\nprince.\nThen Astos carted away the castle\u8166s\ntreasures!\x00
0x5d: I\u8166ve heard rumors of a witch who can\nbrew any potion you could imagine.\n\nLet\u8166s see... I think her name was\nMatoya.\x00
0x5e: You have some jolt tonic? That should\nbe able to rouse the prince!\x00
0x5f: We elves are the keepers of the key.\nWhen the Warriors of Light come, we\nshall entrust it to them.\x00
0x60: A foul creature lives in the cave to the\nwest.\n\nThe rotting of the earth is its doing,\nI just know it.\x00
0x61: I just don\u8166t know what we can do...\nPlease help our prince!\x00
0x62: Our prince was meant to become the\nelf king, but what will happen now?\x00
0x63: In a journey I once took to the west,\nI wandered into an ancient castle.\n\nNot a soul could be found inside\u815dand\nthe whole place gave me the creeps\u815d\nso I got out as fast as I could.\x00
0x64: You\u8166ve defeated Astos and brought\npeace to Elfheim!\x00
0x65: No one knows where Astos, king of the\ndark elves, has gone.\x00
0x66: If the prince does not awaken, there\nwill be no elf king, and we will be at\nthe mercy of the dark elf\u8166s evil power.\x00
0x67: Legend has it that an airship, a vessel\nthat can sail the skies, is buried\nsomewhere.\x00
0x68: Weapons and armor made of mythril are\nsturdy and powerful. You should give\nthem a try. You\u8166d be surprised!\x00
0x69: In the dark abyss above the crescent,\nto the north beyond the smoldering\nmountain, the levistone sleeps.\nSomething awaits you there...\x00
0x6a: By the power of the levistone, a\ngreat sail rises into the sky from the\nsand sea below the crescent!\x00
0x6b: I am a sage. When the time is right,\nthe future is revealed to me. I shall\nwait patiently until then.\x00
0x6c: Ah\u8166m lookin for some levistone.\n\n\nIt\u8166s supposed tae be an amazin material\nthat actually floats in the air!\x00
0x6d: That Nerrick, he\u8166s a great dwarf\u815dthe\nkynd ye can really leuk up tae.\x00
0x6e: That soond? Aye, that\u8166s Nerrick. He\u8166s\nsmushin rocks in the back o the cave.\x00

0x70: Have ye blethered wi oor smith, Smyth?\nIn the smithy he is.\x00
0x71: Wi a crystal eye, e\u8166en the blind can see.\n\n\nAh hear that the dark elf Astos pilked\nthe one belongin tae Matoya.\x00

0x76: There micht hae been some nitro pouder\nin the castle treasure hoose way back\nwhen they sealed er up.\x00
0x77: Lali-ho!\x00
0x78: Front-words, back-wards, any way you\nsee! Such a strange spell to swish-\nswish-aree!\nTceles Nottub B.\nSwish-swish-aroo!\x00
0x79: The earth is decaying, and it\u8166s all the\ndoing of the vampire that lives in the\nCavern of Earth.\nOur town is in such rotten shape\nbecause he\u8166s blocking the flow of\nthe power of earth.\nWill you stop him for us?\x00
0x7a: Long ago, Melmond was a beautiful\ntown, blessed by the richness of the\nearth.\x00
0x7b: The giant living in the cave eats rocks.\n\n\nHe\u8166ll eat just about any kind of rock,\nbut I hear he especially likes gems.\nHe can\u8166t get enough of them!\x00
0x7c: The vampire is dead, yet the earth is\nstill decaying. What\u8166s going on?\n\nCould something else be causing it?\x00
0x7d: I\u8166m just a farmer.\x00
0x7e: The Cavern of Earth is to the south of\nMelmond, on a peninsula called the\nDevil\u8166s Tail.\nIt used to be the closer you got to that\ncave, the more fertile the soil. Now...\nNow it\u8166s a barren waste.\x00
0x7f: The Earth Crystal must be shining\nagain!\x00
0x80: The vampire attacked, destroying our\nchurch and leaving our city in shambles.\n\nIs there nothing we can do to stop the\nruination of the earth?\x00
0x81: You aren\u8166t the Warriors of Light, are\nyou?\x00
0x82: In the cave on the southern tip of this\ncontinent lives a man named Sadda.\nHe is a wise man who knows much.\x00
0x83: The vampire is dead, yet the earth is\nstill decaying. What\u8166s going on?\x00
0x84: Long ago, a prosperous civilization\nthrived in the northland.\n\nNow it\u8166s fallen into ruin.\x00
0x85: If the Earth Crystal regains its glow,\nlife will return to the earth. The hills\nand valleys will again be green.\x00
0x86: Warriors of Light...to you we owe our\nthanks. The earth is returning to\nnormal!\x00
0x87: I\u8166ve heard that the ancients possessed\nsomething with the power to make a\nship float in the sky.\x00
0x88: An airship! So they really DO exist!\x00
0x89: Stop by my father\u8166s shop, okay?\x00
0x8a: Well, you\u8166re certainly looking a lot\nspiffier than before!\x00
0x8b: Watts is ma name. Ah\u8166ve gane aw the\nway here frae Duergar tae find oot the\nspringheid of the earth\u8166s decay.\x00
0x8c: Twelve sages are we, guided to this\nland by the stars and prophecy.\x00
0x8d: Four Great Crystals exist in this world.\nThe light that once shone within them\nis now lost...\nThe four Fiends of Chaos block the\npower of the Crystals, claiming it as\ntheir own.\x00
0x8e: Fire, earth, water, and wind...\nThese are the four forces that compose\nour world.\x00
0x8f: The source of the four forces are the\naltars scattered throughout the world.\n\nDefeat the Fiends that have taken root\nthere and lift up the crystal you carry\nto the altar.\nThe crystal should regain its brilliance.\x00
0x90: The four Fiends plot to rule the world\nboth past and present.\n\nThe Fiend of Wind appeared four hundred\nyears ago, followed two hundred years\nlater by the Fiend of Water.\nTogether they laid waste to the\ncivilization in the north.\x00
0x91: The Fiend of Earth rots the land...\x00
0x92: Where the Fiend of Fire passes, all is\ncast into flame...\x00
0x93: When all four Crystals shine once more,\nreturn here.\n\nAll will be revealed...\x00
0x94: Bring the light of the four Crystals to\nus!\n\nWarriors of Light, only you can do this!\x00
0x95: The volcano Mount Gulg rises to the\nwest of this town.\n\nThe Fiend of Fire long slept within its\npassages, but she has awoken two\nhundred years before her time.\nVanquish her before the world is\nconsumed in flame!\x00
0x96: The four forces gather in the Chaos\nShrine, the geographic center of the\nfour altars.\nWith the forces again flowing freely,\nthe time to go to the Chaos Shrine and\nstrike the root of darkness has come!\x00
0x97: The four Crystals shine once again!\n\n\nThe combined power of that light is the\nonly means of breaking through the wall\nof time.\nThe architect of this disaster is beyond\nthat wall, two thousand years in the\npast!\x00
0x98: You would have no memory of this, but\nbefore you wandered into this land, time\nflowed properly for you.\nBut that flow of time has become\nwarped for you here, in this time.\x00
0x99: The chain of time has become looped\nback upon itself...\n\nYou must travel back in time to the link\nin that chain that gave birth to this\ncycle of wrath\u815dand destroy it!\x00
0x9a: The sequence of disasters that began\nfour hundred years ago...\n\nIt was triggered by events that\nhappened only a scant few days in our\npast.\nBut whoever set this in motion has now\nfled two thousand years into the past.\x00
0x9b: I see time spiraling...\n\n\nWhatever went back two thousand\nyears in the past has brought the world\nto the brink of destruction.\nAnd now, two thousand years later, it\ntravels into the past again...\n\nA cycle of wrath without end...\x00
0x9c: An ever-repeating two-thousand-year\ncycle... The warped destiny that gives\nbirth and rebirth to wrath...\nBut it\u8166s no more than an illusion...\na fantasy! And only the Warriors of\nLight can break the cycle!\x00
0x9d: Warriors o Licht...this could nae have\nhappen wioot ye! The earth\u8166s smeddum\nand virr is comin back!\x00
0x9e: Power must be turned toward its proper\nend.\x00
0x9f: I\u8166ve been after the levistone for ten\nyears...\n\nThe cave to the north looks promising,\nbut I can\u8166t go...\n\nI\u8166d never hear the end of it from my\nwife.\x00
0xa0: I am Lukahn.\n\n\nI see...a cycle of wrath...\nA dim light...guided by destiny...\n\nThat about which our entire future\nrevolves...\x00
0xa1: My husband is always traveling, and\nin the little time he IS home, he sleeps\nall day!\nI think he needs to get his priorities\nstraight.\x00
0xa2: Long ago, an ancient race known as the\nSky People used a language called\nLufenian.\nMy brother, Unne, would always talk\nabout it, telling me how he could speak\nit if he only had the Rosetta Stone.\x00
0xa3: You have the Rosetta Stone!?\n\n\nYou must take it to my brother, Unne,\nimmediately!\x00
0xa4: You ever hear of something called\noxyale?\x00
0xa5: Are those legs REALLY yours?\x00

0xa9: Two hundred years ago, the Shrine of\nOnrac flourished. It brimmed with the\npower of water.\nI ask but one thing of you. Please,\nrestore that power to its former grace.\x00
0xaa: The mystic power of the water has\nbeen revived! Now our kingdom will\nonce again flourish!\x00
0xab: You have the look of a warrior about\nyou.\n\nI\u8166m a warrior myself, on a pilgrimage to\nthe Citadel of Trials to earn the\nrecognition of the Dragon King.\nI must return with a token proving my\nstrength and courage.\x00
0xac: Amazing! Humans have been honored by\nthe Dragon King!\x00
0xad: Out of me way! Son of a *hic*! I haven\u8166t\nbeen able to catch me a single fish!\n\nHow\u8166m I supposed to keep food on me\nplate and *hic* in me belly?\x00
0xae: My father\u8166s with the caravan. Right\nnow they\u8166re over in the desert to the\nwest.\nThey usually pitch camp by the forest\nnear the north of the desert.\n\nI hope he comes home soon.\x00
0xaf: Koppe\u8166s been spreading some nonsense\nstory about how he saw some shining\nthing fall out of the sky.\x00
0xb0: The Sunken Shrine is said to be filled\nwith riches.\n\nSilver, gold, diamonds...even tablets\ndescribing lost languages and\ncivilizations, if you believe the legends.\x00
0xb1: Hi, my name\u8166s Koppe. Hm? You want to\nhear about the shining object I saw?\n\nI think it came down somewhere near\nthe waterfall to the north.\n\nNo one believes me, but I think it was\nsome kind of mechanical creature!\x00
0xb2: They say this used to be a beautiful\nvillage until about two hundred years\nago.\x00
0xb3: Smyth: Nae so fast! Those are juist for\ndisplay! You canna fight wi em!\x00
0xb4: If the light of the sea is lost, we will\nturn into sea foam, vanishing forever...\x00
0xb5: If the light of the sea is not restored,\nwe will vanish as foam on the waves...\x00
0xb6: While the Fiend of Water lives, the\nlight of the sea grows ever darker.\x00
0xb7: Oh! My prayers have been answered!\x00
0xb8: This is the uppermost level of the\nshrine.\n\nThe kraken, the Fiend of Water, nests\non its lowest level.\x00
0xb9: Are those the crystals the legends\nspeak of? Just who are you?\x00
0xba: Save the sea. Restore light to the\nWater Crystal.\x00
0xbb: Thank you so much! Now the beauty\nthis stretch of sea once knew will\nsurely return!\x00
0xbc: One of our friends went to see the\nworld above and hasn\u8166t returned.\n\nI wonder what she\u8166s doing now? I do\nhope she\u8166s alright...\x00
0xbd: You can breathe underwater? How?\nHOW!?\x00
0xbe: The Mirage Tower stands in the desert\non the continent to the east, right?\nWell, I saw someone go INTO the tower!\nI remember hearing the most lovely\nchiming sound...\x00
0xbf: This door has been bound by the\nmystic key.\x00
0xc0: This is Gaia. Outsiders often call our\ntown the Eye of the Hawk.\n\nTo our south is an ancient city known\nas the Wing of the Hawk.\x00
0xc1: Have you visited the Wing of the Hawk?\nI can\u8166t understand a word they say\nthere.\x00
0xc2: The legends say the Sky People could\nsoar through the sky and build castles\nabove the clouds.\x00

0xc5: There was a scholar studying the\nLufenian language, but I can\u8166t seem to\nrecall his name.\x00
0xc6: They say a special water called oxyale\ngushes from the bottom of our spring.\nBut only faeries can draw it out.\x00
0xc7: There\u8166s a tower in the Yahnikurm Desert\nthat no one can enter.\n\nSome people think it\u8166s nothing but a\nmirage, so it\u8166s called the Mirage Tower.\nNo one can say for sure, though.\x00
0xc8: I caught the faerie, so I figure she\u8166s\nmine to do with as I please. What\u8166s the\nbig deal?\nSo I sold her to the caravan. So what?\x00
0xc9: My dad was always telling me how the\ncastle to the west was a place to test\nyour courage.\x00
0xca: Busy, busy, busy...\nSwish-swish-aree!\x00
0xcb: That broom\u8166s always trying to weasel\nits way out of its chores. I don\u8166t know\nwhat to do with it!\x00
0xcc: A faerie was living at our spring, but\nI haven\u8166t seen her lately.\n\nI wonder what\u8166s happened to her.\x00
0xcd: Before you leave, legendary warriors,\ntake this chime with you.\n\nIt will grant you passage into the\nMirage Tower.\x00
0xce: The Mirage Tower is our symbol.\x00
0xcf: Four hundred years ago, we had built a\ncivilization of the highest order.\n\nEven beyond the skies we reached...\nBut that is naught but history now.\x00
0xd0: Lu...pa...gamhi...dho?\x00
0xd1: We are the Lufenians, the descendants\nof the race that once lived among the\nclouds\u815dthe Sky People.\nYou use a vessel you call an airship...\n\n\nIt was built by one of our ancestors...\na man by the name of Cid.\x00
0xd2: The castle that floats high above the\nclouds was once the home of our\nancestors.\nThe Mirage Tower is the gateway to\nthat castle.\x00
0xd3: We have a legend that has been passed\ndown through many generations.\n\nAccording to this legend, four hundred\nyears after the fall of the civilization\nin the sky, warriors bearing light will\ncome forth to save our people.\x00
0xd4: We fought a life-and-death struggle\nwith Tiamat, the Fiend of Wind.\n\nBut our power was not enough...\nTo this day her lair remains in the\ncastle in the sky\u815dthe Flying Fortress.\x00
0xd5: We placed our last hope in the five\nwarriors we sent out...\n\nIt\u8166s been said they fell victim to the\ncurse of the Fiends and were turned\ninto bats.\x00
0xd6: We came to believe there was another\nentity controlling the four Fiends.\n\nTo ascertain its location, we sent out\nfive warriors, but much time has passed\nsince we heard from them.\nI hope no harm has befallen them...\x00
0xd7: The Sky People would pass on their\nmemories from one generation to the\nnext through rituals.\nBut four hundred years is a very long\ntime, and those memories have begun\nto fade.\x00
0xd8: The Light Bearers! Then the legend is\ntrue!\x00
0xd9: This world is composed of four forces:\nfire, earth, water, and wind.\n\nOf these, we showed greatest prowess\nwith the power of wind.\n\nHigh in the sky, we set a castle afloat\namidst an azure sea of stars.\x00
0xda: Tiamat blocks the power of wind, the\nsource of the Sky People\u8166s strength.\x00
0xdb: Here lies Link.\x00
0xdc: Could the mechanical beings our\nancestors created still function?\x00
0xdd: The flying castle floats on a blue sea\nof stars beyond the sky.\x00
0xde: ...our FRIEND left on a journey...\n...to the WEST...\n\n...he took the WARP cube...\n...and went to see our masTER...\x00
0xdf: ...use the WARP cube to travel...\n...beyond the SKY...\n\n...it WILL take you to the...\n...flying FORtress...\x00
0xe0: ...masTER!...\n...we have waited SO long...\x00
0xe1: ...from this observation WINdow...\n...you can look out on...\n...the ENTIRE world...\x00
0xe2: It is a rare thing to have humans visit\nus here.\n\nIf you are valiant warriors, you should\nspeak with Bahamut, our king.\x00
0xe3: The dragons of the Cardian Islands have\nno love of senseless killing.\x00
0xe4: Once, long ago, there was an age when\nman and dragon lived together.\x00
0xe5: You do not fear me... You have some\nspine in you, human.\x00
0xe6: Let\u8166s take a peek at your reflection in\nthe water...\n\nUgh! You\u8166re filthy! Wash up already!\x00
0xe7: It is customary for a dragon to venture\nnortheast to the Citadel of Trials.\n\nThere, he must test his mettle by\nclaiming a token of courage from within.\x00
0xe8: The form the token of courage takes\nchanges with the times. Do not let its\nappearance deceive you.\x00
0xe9: Have you spoken with our king,\nBahamut?\n\nThe Dragon King confers a great honor\nupon the brave.\x00
0xea: Only the truly brave can obtain a token\nof their courage.\x00
0xeb: Once, long ago, the northland was filled\nwith beautiful shrines and towering\nmechanical castles.\nSo very long ago...\x00
0xec: This is the chamber of Bahamut, the\nDragon King. Mind your tongue.\x00
0xed: The Dragon King looks within to measure\na person\u8166s true courage.\x00
0xee: You see a gravestone.\x00
0xef: It\u8166s a well. It looks like you could climb\ninside, but you can\u8166t. Really.\x00
0xf0: \u2530 obtained from the\nchest!\x00
0xf1: You can\u8166t hold any more!\x00

0xf5: This is the Altar of Water, from which\nthe power of water flows forth.\x00

0xf7: F7\x00
0xf8: ...analyzing TIAmat...\n...no known WEAKNESS...\x00
0xf9: The observation window looks out upon\nthe world.\n\nThe four forces of fire, earth, water,\nand wind appear as a mist converging\non a single point...\n...a point at the center of the four\nAltars. This must be the location of\nthe Chaos Shrine!\x00

0x112: Pravoka is a port town. The pirates\nthere just might have a ship.\x00
0x113: Have you been to the Western Keep?\n\n\nThey say the crown from the Marsh\nCave can restore the fallen keep...\x00

0x120: The King: Thank you for returning my\ndaughter to my side.\n\nThere can be no doubt that you are\nthe Warriors of Light from Lukahn\u8166s\nprophecy!\nYou should hear the prophecy in its\nentirety. Ahem. If I may...\n\n\u8168When darkness veils the world, four\n Warriors of Light shall come.\n\n\u8168If they cannot gather the shards of\n light, the darkness will consume all.\n\n\u8168The four Crystals will never shine\n again...\u8168\n\nNow, I hear that a Crystal can be found\non the continent to our north.\n\nRestoring light to the Crystals is our\nonly hope of ridding the world of the\nmonsters which plague it!\x00
0x121: The King: Welcome, travelers. I am told\nyou carry crystals. Is this true?\x00
0x122: It\u8166s just as Lukahn\u8166s prophecy foretold:\n\u8168When darkness veils the world, four\n Warriors of Light shall come.\u8168\x00
0x123: Chancellor: Your Majesty, we cannot be\ncertain that these are the warriors\nforetold by the prophecy.\x00
0x124: The King: Yet they stand before us\nwith the crystals. I cannot dismiss this\nas mere coincidence.\nCrystal bearers, there is a task I would\nask of you.\n\nWill you not rescue my daughter, Sarah?\x00
0x125: Chancellor: Garland, a knight once in\nHis Majesty\u8166s service, has abducted\nPrincess Sarah.\nI ask for your aid in the name of His\nMajesty, the king of Cornelia.\n\nGarland has taken refuge in the Chaos\nShrine, which lies to our north.\n\nOf course, we did attempt to save the\nprincess ourselves...\n\nBut Garland is the finest swordsman in\nthe kingdom. We have none who can\nmatch him.\x00
0x126: The King: I have heard that you wish to\njourney to the continent to our north.\n\nThe bridge leading north was lost long\nago, making passage impossible.\n\nIf you can rescue Sarah, I will have the\nbridge rebuilt as a sign of my gratitude.\n\nGo now, Warriors of Light, and do not\nfail me!\x00
0x127: I will have the bridge to the north\nrebuilt, as I promised.\n\nI pray that you succeed in restoring\nlight to the four Crystals\u815dand to the\nworld.\x00

0x132: You...you\u8166ve come to rescue me?\nI don\u8166t know how I can ever thank you...\n\nI am Sarah, princess of Cornelia.\n\n\nThat\u8166s the first time anyone\u8166s ever\ndefeated Garland.\n\nYou must allow me to show my\ngratitude. Please, accompany me to\nCastle Cornelia.\x00

0x214: Matoya: Oh, what\u8166s this? My crystal\neye? Give it here!\n\nDon\u8166t worry, I have something to give\nyou in exchange. Take this potion.\n\nIt\u8166s the most amazing potion in my\nentire collection!\x00
0x215: Ahh! I can see! I can see again!\x00

0x219: Sadda: So you are the ones who\ndefeated the vampire, eh?\n\nBut he was only a servant... The beast\ncorrupting the Earth Crystal lurks far\ndeeper within the cavern.\nHere. Take this staff with you and use\nit behind the vampire\u8166s chamber!\x00

0x221: Aye-aye, Cap\u8166n! We\u8166ll make their bones\ngo crunch!\x00
0x222: Bikke: I be most sorry, young masters.\nI\u8166ll be makin\u8166 no more fuss, I swear.\n\nI want ye to take me ship fer yer\ntroubles. Can ye find it in yer heart\nto fergive an old pirate?\x00
0x223: 0\x00
0x224: You obtain a ship.\x00
0x225: I would be most happy to teach you\nabout equipment. Would you care to\nlisten?\x00
0x226: Equipment can be split into two\ncategories: weapons and armor.\n\nEquipping a weapon will increase your\nAttack rating.\n\nThere are four types of armor: shields,\nhelms, gloves, and body armor.\n\nAny armor you wear on your body,\nincluding armlets, is classified as body\narmor.\nShields are held in one hand, while\nhelms are worn on the head.\n\nRemember that the weapons and armor\nyou find won\u8166t do you any good unless\nyou equip them from the main menu.\nSelecting \u8168Optimal\u8168 will automatically\nequip the strongest weapons and armor\nin your inventory.\x00
0x227: I\u8166ve been known to give quite a lecture\non the use of magic. Have a listen?\x00
0x228: There are two schools of magic: black\nand white.\n\nWhite magic is comprised of healing and\ndefensive spells, while black magic\nspells are of the offensive variety.\nEach level of black and white magic\ncontains four distinct spells.\n\nHowever, any given character can only\nlearn three of the four spells of a\nparticular magic level.\nYou can use the \u8168Discard\u8168 command to\nwipe your memory of any spell you\u8166ve\npreviously learned.\nIf you want to relearn a spell you\npreviously discarded, you can do that,\ntoo.\nTry to choose a combination of spells\nthat works well with your fighting\nstyle.\x00
0x229: If you need to know about items, you\u8166ve\ncertainly come to the right person! As\nlong as you\u8166re here, why not hear, eh?\x00
0x22a: It never hurts to carry a lot of potions,\nantidotes, and the like with you.\n\nStocking up on items in advance will\nhelp you conserve your magic for the\ntimes you need it most.\nNow let\u8166s move on to sleeping bags,\ntents, and cottages, shall we?\n\nThese three splendid items allow you to\nrestore your HP and MP. You can only\nuse them outdoors, though.\nIn addition to these traditional items,\ncertain pieces of equipment may be used\nas items as well.\nThe only way to know if a given piece\nof equipment has a use is to try it out,\nso experimentation is the key.\nIn the course of your travels, you will\ncome across unique item types that are\nknown as \u8168key items.\u8168\nSome key items have an effect when\nused in an important location.\x00
0x22b: Would you like to tarry for just a\nmoment to hear about monsters?\x00
0x22c: There are many different types of\nmonsters, and different types have\ndifferent weaknesses.\nFinding a monster\u8166s weakness will help\nyou gain the upper hand in battle.\n\nFor example, aquatic monsters are\nsusceptible to lightning.\n\nCasting Thunder on these monsters\nwill deal particularly heavy damage.\n\nSome weapons are also more effective\nagainst certain monsters.\x00

0x251: I believe you could cross rivers if you\nhad something like a canoe.\n\nYes, I believe I heard the sages of\nCrescent Lake saying something about\nthat.\x00
0x252: By the by, have you ever heard of a\nship that can sail through the air?\n\nThe levistone, spoken of by the elven\nsages, has something to do with it...\x00
0x253: There\u8166s just one thing holding you back\nfrom being truly exalted Warriors of\nLight...\nYou need more dignified titles. Have you\ngiven any thought to that?\n\nThere\u8166s a dragon in Onrac who\u8166s very\nup on his titles.\x00
0x254: So you\u8166ve been to the Citadel of Trials,\nbut you still don\u8166t have your token of\ncourage?\x00
0x255: Carrying around a rat\u8166s tail, are we?\n\n\nWell, I suppose it\u8166s better than nothing.\nMaybe it\u8166s time to go pay a visit to the\nDragon King.\x00
0x256: By the by, I\u8166ve been thinking that\n\u8168crescent\u8168 may not be referring to the\nmoon after all.\nI have a hunch that it might be\ndescribing the body of water around the\ntown of Crescent Lake.\n...Just a hunch, mind you.\x00
0x257: I\u8166m afraid there\u8166s nothing more I can tell\nyou at the moment.\n\nRestoring light to one of the Crystals\njust might make something happen\u815dbut\nwho knows?\x00

0x282: This place is known as the Hellfire\nChasm.\n\nElves who would be king once proved\ntheir worth by seeking out treasure\ndeep within.\nNow it is sealed off to all, it seems...\x00
0x283: The heat surrounding the door is gone!\n\n\nBut now that our prince has become\nking, no one is likely to enter any time\nsoon.\x00
0x284: Yipes! Peoples!\n\n\nY-you aren\u8166t going to hurt me?\nThen maybe I can tell you a little about\nthis place.\nThis cavern is known as the Lifespring\nGrotto.\n\nLong ago, men and mermaids who fell\nin love could live here together in\npeace.\x00
0x285: The water flowing from the grotto is\npure once more.\n\nWho knows? Maybe someday I\u8166ll fall\nin love with a man and come to live\nhere...\x00
0x286: This is Whisperwind Cove. Our forebears\nentrusted many treasures to its depths.\n\nNow sealed for many ages, it is become\na lonely place.\x00
0x287: Tiamat\u8166s defeat in the Flying Fortress\nhas shattered the seal on the cavern!\n\nShe must have sealed it out of fear\nof our forebears\u8166 powers.\x00

0x289: ????: So, you\u8166ve managed to reach\nthese depths. I commend you.\n\nBut your journey ends here, I\u8166m afraid.\x00
0x28a: ????: There are none who can stop\nme in all of creation!\n\nYou, too, shall fall before me!\x00
0x28b: ????: In me are all things great and\nsmall extinguished.\n\nDie now, Warriors of Light!\x00
0x28c: ????: Oooohh...\n\n\nWhat a treat! What a treat to be the\none to send you to your graves!\n\nPerish knowing that it was Scarmiglione\nwho fed your corpses to the earth!\x00
0x28d: Scarmiglione: You\u8166ve given me a fine\ndeath! Indeed you have!\n\nAnd only in death can you know the true\nterror of Scarmiglione!\x00
0x28e: ????: You\u8166re just in time, my little\nplaymates...\n\nI get so lonely here... Won\u8166t you keep\nme company?\x00
0x28f: ????: I suppose I underestimated you.\nI didn\u8166t think you would make it this\nfar.\nNo matter. Barbariccia\u8166s winds shall\ncut you down!\x00

0x2a2: Why has this happened?\x00
0x2a3: Dark Bahamut: Welcome.\n\n\nHere the bold are tested to see\nwhether they are fit to advance\nbeyond.\nIf you would proceed, you must first\nface my disciples.\n\n\u2573: \u2564\n\u2573: \u2564\n\u2573: \u2564\nDefeat them and you may pass.\nSpeak to me again if you wish to know\nhow many you\u8166ve defeated.\x00

0x2a5: Dark Bahamut: I see that you are indeed\nworthy of proceeding.\n\nYou are free to pass.\n\n\nBut remember this:\nThe real trial is only just beginning.\x00
0x2a6: Dark Bahamut: What?\nDo you fear what is to come?\x00
0x2a7: It is rare that we have human visitors.\x00
0x2a8: I am still but a novice. I must earn\nMaster Bahamut\u8166s favor soon.\x00
0x2a9: May your future be bathed in light.\x00
0x2aa: I worry about the family I left in the\nworld above... \x00
0x2ab: Returning to the world above every\nnow and then might not be such a bad\nthing!\x00
0x2ac: Help...us...\n\n\nThat monstrosity beyond the bridge\ntransformed us into the grotesque\nforms you see now.\nIf you can defeat it, we should revert\nto our former selves!\n\nPlease...heed our plea!\x00
0x2ad: You must defeat it... \nThere is no other way.\x00
0x2ae: Please...wait... \x00

0x2b6: Oh, thank you ever so much!\x00

0x2ca: It was a bit dodgy there for a bit.\nI wasn\u8166t quite sure how things would\nturn out!\x00
0x2cb: Even though I couldn\u8166t move, I was still\naware of everything that was going on.\nPretty neat, huh?\x00
0x2cc: Hmm, why did the Phantom Train appear\nin our village?\n\nI don\u8166t think I\u8166ll be able to sleep at\nnight until I find out.\x00
0x2cd: Thank you so much for saving us!\nOh, I\u8166m afraid words aren\u8166t enough to\nexpress my gratitude.\nPlease come back and visit anytime!\x00
0x2ce: All these beautiful flowers... \nIt\u8166s so soothing.\x00
0x2cf: So this place was a graveyard until a\nlittle while ago? Well I\u8166ll be...\x00

0x321: Welcome to our village, Fey\u815d\n\n\nOh, it\u8166s you! Thanks for helping me out!\x00
0x322: We can live in the world above no more.\x00
0x323: Humans, monsters... Enough is enough!\x00
0x324: Aiiieee! Humans!?\n\n\nFirst monsters and now this...\nOur village grows more dangerous by\nthe day!\nI fear we may have to leave again\nsomeday soon... \x00
0x325: Oxyale is the water of life. We can\u8166t\nbe giving it out to just anyone.\x00
0x326: Isn\u8166t it lovely here by the water\u8166s\nedge?\x00
0x327: The children really want to venture\ninto the outside world.\n\nJust the other day one child who had\nleft was captured by a human.\n\nFortunately, she\u8166s safe now. The\nWarriors of Light came to her rescue.\x00
0x328: Everyone says they feel safe here.\nBut we mustn\u8166t let ourselves grow too\ncomplacent.\x00
0x329: Maybe I\u8166ll go see the outside world for\nmyself...\n\nJust think of all the new experiences\nthat could be waiting!\x00
0x32a: The outside world? I\u8166d be lying if I said\nI wasn\u8166t a teensy bit curious.\x00
0x32b: How did it come to this? Why must we\nlive here in such isolation?\x00
0x32c: Welcome to our village, Feyhome.\nThere are many of us here, as you\u8166ll\nsee!\nAmong us you\u8166ll surely find some willing\nto help you, oh yes!\n\nBut do watch out. Tricksy ones await\nyou, too.\n\nWhich is which? That one or this?\nTalk to them and you will know, oh yes!\x00
0x32d: My, you look exhausted!\x00
0x32e: Feeling any better?\nOf course you are!\x00
0x32f: Oh, dear. You look dreadful... \nChin up and off you go!\x00
0x330: Off with you now! Chin up!\x00
0x331: You\u8166ve got things a bit too easy, if you\nask me. That won\u8166t do!\x00
0x332: Learned your lesson yet?\x00
0x333: Look at you, all ship and shape.\nWhere\u8166s the fun in that?\x00
0x334: Put some wind in your sails, did I?\x00
0x335: Hey! Listen!\n\n\nI found a hidden staircase while I was\nplaying!\x00
0x336: I\u8166m the living end, aren\u8166t I?\nTee hee hee!\x00
0x337: I\u8166m researching whether a certain branch\nof psychology can be adapted and\napplied to monsters.\nAfter all, monsters are people too.\x00
0x338: My research on darkness and light could\nprove vital to saving the world.\n\nPlease, no interruptions!\n\n\nWait just a moment. No, it can\u8166t be...\nAre you...the Warriors of Light?\n\nThis is incredible! We must tell the\nothers at once!\x00
0x339: What exactly IS the kraken? And, more\nto the point, how might one go about\ndefeating it?\nI don\u8166t know! I just don\u8166t know!\x00
0x33a: If I could only find a way to create\nadamantite, I\u8166d be rich!\n\nUwahahahaha!\x00
0x33b: Hmmm. I see...\x00
0x33c: Well, you see... That is to say...\nActually, strike that. Ahem. It will be\na tremendous success.\nI think...\x00
0x33d: Now, where was that... \x00
0x33e: The sun will surely rise tomorrow.\nI\u8166m certain it will!\x00
0x33f: The waxing and waning of the moon is a\nmost peculiar phenomenon.\n\nIt influences the very seas themselves!\x00
0x340: I COULD get out of your way...\x00
0x341: Destiny lays a unique path before each\nof us. We have no choice but to follow\nit.\nWhere will your path lead you?\x00
0x342: Pardon? You want to know what I was\nresearching?\n\nSometimes I have trouble remembering\nmyself... \x00
0x343: It must be here somewhere! It must!\nHrm? What must be here, you ask?\n\nWhy, the reason the Crystals shine,\nof course!\x00
0x344: *flip* *flip*\x00
0x345: I do hope Unne is doing well... \x00
0x346: Peace will return again. It will.\n\n\nThe results of my research are\nincontrovertible.\x00
0x347: Yes? Do you need something? I haven\u8166t\ngot all day. If you need something,\nspeak up!\x00
0x348: Tomorrow. Yesterday. Between the two\nlies today.\n\nThat there is a today means, by\nextension, that tomorrow and yesterday\nmust exist as well.\x00
0x349: I\u8166ve been looking into the prophecies\nof the sages in Elfheim.\n\nIt\u8166s quite astounding, actually. Their\nprophecies have an uncanny tendency\nto come true.\x00
0x34a: We can do it. We have the capability.\n\n\nAs long as we believe in ourselves,\nthere\u8166s nothing we can\u8166t accomplish!\x00
0x34b: Love... There is no greater mystery\nknown to us.\n\nWhat in the world IS that confounded\nemotion?\x00
0x34c: That\u8166s impossible! It has no conceivable\nbasis in reality!\x00
0x34d: Have you ever seen a ghost?\n\n\nThe reasons why they appear remain\nshrouded in mystery.\x00
0x34e: Scholars are prone to focus on one\nthing to the exclusion of all else.\x00
0x34f: Wait... Wait for it... *sigh*\nI\u8166ve forgotten what I was just thinking\nabout!\nUmm...what was it? I can\u8166t remember!\x00
0x350: Hmm... Now I see!\x00
0x351: How odd. This isn\u8166t my study...\nWell, no matter.\n\nThe things I must do must still be done.\x00
0x352: Yes, that\u8166s right. No doubt about it.\x00
0x353: A mysterious power seems to be\ngathering...\n\nWe must investigate it quickly, before\nsomething terrible befalls us.\x00
0x354: Move? I\u8166ll do no such thing!\nThere\u8166s a book I need up this way.\n\nI won\u8166t let you interfere with my\nresearch!\x00
0x355: I\u8166ve no doubt that this peace will be a\nlasting one.\n\nI suppose I\u8166m now free to carry on my\nstudies.\x00
0x356: I\u8166ve spent a hundred years looking for a\nway to use white and black magic\ntogether.\nMy research has yet to bear any fruit.\n\n\nWill my childhood dream go forever\nunfulfilled?\x00
0x357: Pestering, pestering, pestering pest!\x00
0x358: Get out of your way?\nHmmm, I don\u8166t think so!\x00
0x359: Where are you going? Hm?\nWhat did you say?\x00
0x35a: Nothing to see here.\nMove along, move along.\x00
0x35b: No trespassing!\nDon\u8166t take another step!\x00
0x35c: What are you doing here?\nShoo! Shoo!\x00
0x35d: Whaddaya think you\u8166re doin\u8166?\nHuh? You want through here?\nAre you crazy?\x00
0x35e: How would you like to live here with\nus? Forever and ever...\x00
0x35f: A journey without a companion is like\na world without compassion. So, uh,\nwhy not live here with us?\x00
0x360: Where do you think you\u8166re going?\nYou\u8166re not allowed through here!\x00
0x361: What\u8166s over there? You wanna know\nwhat\u8166s over there? Well, I can\u8166t tell\nyou what\u8166s over there!\x00
0x362: This area is restricted.\nAuthorized personnel only.\x00
0x363: No entry until you\u8166ve seen the\nreceptionist. Of course, there is no\nreceptionist... \x00
0x364: Look, it\u8166s nothing personal.\nThey order me to not let anyone\nthrough, so I don\u8166t.\nSo, can I ask you to turn around and\nhead back?\x00
0x365: Hold it! Shoes off right now!\n\n\nNot that you\u8166ll be allowed in any\nfurther anyway...\x00
0x366: This is private property.\nTrespassers will be burninated.\x00
0x367: None shall pass.\x00
0x368: Psst! You should turn back while you\nstill can. How do I know?\n\nBecause that\u8166s what they told me to\nsay!\x00
0x369: Go. No. Further.\x00
0x36a: Bad adventurers!\nYou\u8166re not supposed to be here!\nBad, bad adventurers!\x00
0x36b: Construction up ahead.\nPlease take an alternate route.\x00
0x36c: Simon says, \u8168Stand still!\u8168\nHey, you moved! You lose! You lose!\x00
0x36d: Sorry, you can\u8166t go any further.\nYou might as well just give up now.\x00
0x36e: Just what do you think you\u8166re doing,\nchildren? Back to your seats! Move it!\x00
0x36f: Remember, I\u8166m only asking this as a\npersonal favor. Okay?\n\nPlease! Don\u8166t go on! I\u8166m begging you!\nBEGGING YOU!\x00
0x370: I wanted to ask you something.\nI\u8166m afraid it may take a while, though.\nIs that okay? It is? Wonderful!\x00
0x371: So, you are the crystal bearers...\n\n\nGreat misfortune shall befall you\nshould you proceed.\n\nI implore you, stop now, before it is\ntoo late.\x00
0x372: G-g-go no further, I b-b-beg of you.\x00
0x373: Let\u8166s see, what was it? Oh, right.\n\n\nGo no further! Danger awaits! Ooh!\x00
0x374: Beware falling rocks!\nYou must turn back now!\x00
0x375: Yes, what is it?\nYou wish to go on?\x00
0x376: You are not permitted to proceed any\nfarther. Accept fate, do not fight it.\x00
0x377: 0\x00
0x378: One, two! One, two! All together now!\nOne, two! One, two!\x00
0x379: Don\u8166t you want to dance? It feels so\ngreat to work up a sweat!\x00
0x37a: 0\x00
0x37b: Hey, you wanna watch me dance?\nNot so fast! You have to come see me\nonstage!\x00
0x37c: I made it into the Crystal Company!\nIf I work hard enough, I\u8166ll be a star!\x00
0x37d: I\u8166m hoping to play the princess of\nCornelia in \u8168I Want to Be Your Canary\u8168!\x00
0x37e: I have to keep practicing if I want to\nclear the Tantalus Theatre Troupe\ntryouts!\x00
0x37f: Ugh, I can\u8166t get it right no matter how\nmany times I try! Maybe I just don\u8166t\nhave what it takes...\x00
0x380: This dance is intense, really intense!\nThis is what dancing is all about, right?\x00
0x381: Dancing soothes the soul.\x00
0x382: Have you heard of the Tantalus\nTheatre Troupe?\x00
0x383: I\u8166ve gotta improve...\x00
0x384: C\u8166mon, let\u8166s dance!\x00
0x385: Excuse me, I\u8166m trying to practice my\nwaltz.\x00
0x386: I just can\u8166t seem to master the tango.\x00
0x387: I\u8166m trying to dance to the blues...and it\nain\u8166t easy!\x00
0x388: Do you mind? I\u8166m practicing the rhumba\nhere!\x00
0x389: Do you know the samba?\x00
0x38a: I just started practicing the salsa\nyesterday.\x00
0x38b: The flamenco is such a sultry dance,\ndon\u8166t you think?\x00
0x38c: When you dance, you just have to let\nyourself go!\x00
0x38d: What do you think of my dancing?\x00
0x38e: Dancing is my reason for living.\nI\u8166m not stopping now!\x00
0x38f: I\u8166m getting pretty sick of dancing!\x00
0x390: The mambo is all in the hips.\x00
0x391: I\u8166m trying to tap dance my way to the\ntop!\x00
0x392: Jazz isn\u8166t half bad!\x00
0x393: You\u8166ve gotta be limber to limbo.\x00
0x394: 0\x00
0x395: Doesn\u8166t dancing the hula put you in a\ntropical mood? Maybe it\u8166s just me...\x00
0x396: I wonder how much longer I can keep\ndancing like this...\x00
0x397: The ability to draw on both black and\nwhite magic is the red mage\u8166s specialty.\n\nOf course, it also takes that much more\nwork.\x00
0x398: What? You mean I can\u8166t use the best\nwhite magic spells?\x00
0x399: What? You mean I can\u8166t use the best\nblack magic spells?\x00
0x39a: I want to be able to cast both black\nAND white magic.\x00
0x39b: I\u8166m looking for a way to shorten our\nspell incantations.\x00
0x39c: I never miss a fencing lesson.\x00
0x39d: We\u8166re sometimes mistaken for fighters,\nbut we\u8166re mages through and through.\x00
0x39e: Another class of spells known as blue\nmagic is said to exist...\x00
0x39f: I think I\u8166m much more fit for combat\nthan any black wizard.\x00
0x3a0: Though there are red mages, there\u8166s\nno such thing as red magic.\x00
0x3a1: \u8168To fight, to support, and to protect.\u8168\nThat\u8166s my motto.\x00
0x3a2: It seems there is something you might\ncall a \u8168magic level.\u8168\n\nBut how does one advance it quickly?\nI just don\u8166t know...\x00
0x3a3: We\u8166re playing hide-and-seek, but\nthere\u8166s this one kid I can\u8166t find\nanywhere...\nI know! You should help me look!\nIf you find him for me, I\u8166ll tell you\nsomething real important!\x00
0x3a4: We\u8166re playing hide-and-seek, but there\u8166s\nthis one kid I can\u8166t find ANYwhere...\n\nI know! You should help me look!\nIf you find him for me, I\u8166ll tell you\nsomething real important!\nI guess you\u8166ll need to know what he\nlooks like, huh? Let\u8166s see...\n\nHe\u8166s a kid with black hair! Come lemme\nknow once you find him!\x00
0x3a5: We\u8166re playing hide-and-seek, but there\u8166s\nthis one kid I can\u8166t find ANYwhere...\n\nI know! You should help me look!\nIf you find him for me, I\u8166ll tell you\nsomething real important!\nI guess you\u8166ll need to know what he\nlooks like, huh? Let\u8166s see...\n\nHe\u8166s a kid with blue hair! Come lemme\nknow once you find him!\x00
0x3a6: We\u8166re playing hide-and-seek, but there\u8166s\nthis one kid I can\u8166t find ANYwhere...\n\nI know! You should help me look!\nIf you find him for me, I\u8166ll tell you\nsomething real important!\nI guess you\u8166ll need to know what he\nlooks like, huh? Let\u8166s see...\n\nHe\u8166s a kid with red hair! Come lemme\nknow once you find him!\x00
0x3a7: Really? He was hiding THERE? Thanks!\x00
0x3a8: Oh! There\u8166s a stairway over there in the\ncorner. You can use it if you want to!\x00
0x3a9: What!? You\u8166re IT?\nShucks, you found me.\x00
0x3aa: Aw, you found me.\x00
0x3ab: Three cheers for Toy Town!\x00
0x3ac: Mommy? Daddy?\nWhere are you!?\x00
0x3ad: Mecha-Bahamut is SO cool!\x00
0x3ae: I bought me a 1/144 scale model of an\nairship. When I grow up, I\u8166m gonna get me\na real one!\x00
0x3af: Do you have a Trance Kuja action\nfigure?\n\nIt\u8166s the last one I need to complete the\nset!\x00
0x3b0: My dad\u8166s REALLY rich. Maybe I\u8166ll have\nhim buy me this whole town.\x00
0x3b1: Woohoo! I won! I won!\x00
0x3b2: There\u8166s no swing!\nI wanna swing!\x00
0x3b3: I\u8166m tired of this place. I wanna go\nsomewhere FUN, but I can\u8166t find the\nway out.\x00
0x3b4: Toy Town, huh? Meh, it\u8166s just some\nplace they made up to fool us kids.\x00
0x3b5: What IS this place...\nOooh, I want what he\u8166s playin\u8166 with!\x00
0x3b6: I...I l-lost my t-t-toy...\x00
0x3b7: Pardon me. Do you know where they sell\ncards?\x00
0x3b8: Hang on, what was I looking for\nagain?\n\nI\u8166ve seen so many different things now,\nI forgot!\x00
0x3b9: I wonder if they still have those\nMatoya pinups everybody\u8166s talkin\u8166\nabout...\x00
0x3ba: I woke up, and I was here... If I don\u8166t\nget back soon, I\u8166ll be late for class.\x00
0x3bb: Graduate from a good school, find a\ngood job... That\u8166s all I ever hear outta\nmy mom.\x00
0x3bc: Lately I\u8166ve been forgettin\u8166 something\nreal important. At least, I think I am.\nI wonder what it is...\x00
0x3bd: Maybe it\u8166s time I headed home. But it\nlooks like it still won\u8166t be dark for a\nwhile... What should I do?\x00
0x3be: What time is it? I feel like I\u8166ve been\nplaying forever, but it still isn\u8166t\ngetting dark.\x00
0x3bf: I went into a toy store, but nobody was\nthere. I guess all the grown-ups are\nbusy.\x00
0x3c0: I gotta have it!\nI REALLY gotta have it!\x00
0x3c1: I\u8166ve been lookin\u8166 for that toy for AGES.\nNext time I see my grandma, I\u8166m gonna\nbeg her to get it for me.\x00
0x3c2: Toys here, toys there, toys everywhere!\x00
0x3c3: Ugh, I\u8166m always gettin\u8166 lost. I wonder\nif they sell maps to this place... \x00
0x3c4: Go in this house, come out that house.\nGo in that house, come out this house.\nI love this place!\x00
0x3c5: Forget toys. I like fishing!\nFishing\u8166s way more fun!\x00
0x3c6: Maybe it\u8166s time I went home.\x00
0x3c7: I wonder where me mum and dad went.\nEh, whatever.\x00
0x3c8: Toys, toys, toys!\nToys are the bestest thing ever!\x00
0x3c9: How come an ace beats a king?\nI don\u8166t get it.\x00
0x3ca: I\u8166ve been having these weird thoughts\nlately...\n\nLike how did I end up in this town?\x00
0x3cb: Toy Town? It\u8166s just something they\nmade up to fool us kids.\x00
0x3cc: What!? You\u8166re IT?\nShucks, you found me.\x00

0x3fc: The statue radiates a searing heat...\x00
0x3fd: Fetid water seeps from the statue...\x00
0x3fe: The statue resonates with the eerie\nhowling of wind...\x00
0x3ff: You hear a lock spring in the\ndistance... \x00
0x400: From some source unseen, the scent\nof flowers is carried to you on the\nbreeze...\x00
0x401: It seems to be missing some parts.\x00
0x402: You find nothing of use.\x00
0x403: You obtain the \u2530!\x00
0x404: Goblin: We be nothin\u8166 more than cannon\nfodder...\n\nNever \u8166ave the chance to show what\nwe\u8166re really made of.\x00

0x408: Ogre: Me want use magic, too.\n\n\nMe try and try, but me not learn... \x00

0x40b: Gargoyle: To be tired. To think about\nfinding a place to rest my wings.\x00
0x40c: Piscodemon: I really wanted to use\nmagic...\x00
0x40d: Mummy: I go to all that trouble to rise\nfrom the dead, and for what?\n\nI end up getting sent to this place.\nPfft!\x00

0x426: Send this beaver back out?\x00
0x427: I keep running into this big man lately.\x00
0x428: I haven\u8166t seen that big man in a while.\x00
0x429: I like it here, don\u8166t get me wrong, but it\nis nice to do a little sunbathing every\nnow and then.\x00
0x42a: People? Here? How odd... It isn\u8166t often\nthat anyone besides mermaids comes to\nour village.\x00
0x42b: You do realize you\u8166re underwater, right?\nHow come you haven\u8166t gone belly-up\nyet?\nOxyale, huh? What will they think of\nnext?\x00
0x42c: That big guy is great! You little guys\nare great! Everybody is great!\x00
0x42d: Do you like our village? It\u8166s nice to live\nin such a quiet, peaceful place.\x00
0x42e: The other day, I saw a barrel swimming\nthrough the ocean. But that couldn\u8166t\nbe...could it?\x00
0x42f: My friend in the Sunken Shrine said the\nWarriors of Light came!\n\nWhat? You\u8166re the Warriors of Light!?\x00
0x430: Are you...people? What are you doing\nhere?\x00
0x431: The force of water was greatly\nweakened, but it seems to have\nrecovered now.\nWhat a relief!\x00
0x432: I wish I\u8166D been born with red fins...\x00
0x433: They say an enormous monster was\nliving in the Sunken Shrine. I hope\neverything turned out okay...\x00
0x434: Are those THE crystals!?\nWow, the Warriors of Light sure are\nyounger than I expected.\x00
0x435: Can you imagine a place more peaceful?\nWhy not live here with us?\x00
0x436: I\u8166ve heard that there are other places\nwhere mermaids live, too.\x00
0x437: Our village is peaceful, but it\u8166s not\nvery exciting.\x00
0x438: Have I seen anyone suspicious?\nHave I ever!\n\nThis guy wanted to know if there was a\ntreasure chest inside. When I said yes,\nhe barged right in!\nWell, as soon as he rushed in, I locked\nthe door behind him. But I can\u8166t keep him\nlocked up forever...\nWould you help me chase him out of\nthere?\x00
0x439: I\u8166m counting on you!\x00
0x43a: Hmph! Some help you are!\x00
0x43b: This is my favorite cave. I feel at peace\nhere.\x00
0x43c: I wonder what it\u8166s like up there on land.\nI\u8166d love to see it someday.\x00
0x43d: This door won\u8166t budge. It\u8166s been like\nthis for a little while now.\n\nCome to think of it, I haven\u8166t been able\nto get in since that dangerous-looking\nman showed up.\x00
0x43e: Suddenly the door opens normally again.\nHow very odd...\x00
0x43f: A strange man carrying a big halberd\ncame running through a minute ago.\n\nHe was shouting, \u8168How do I get out of\nhere?\u8168 So I told him about the warp\nzone inside.\nHonestly, men these days just don\u8166t\nknow how to address a lady!\n\nWhat\u8166s that? Unlock the door?\nAlright, alright, I heard you...\x00
0x440: Aren\u8166t you going to go in?\x00
0x441: This is the mermaid village of Seahold.\n\n\nA strange man carrying a halberd\narrived not long ago.\n\nApparently he\u8166s looking for a sword of\nmatchless power.\n\nSince our village is connected to the\nsea, all sorts of things wash up here.\nPerhaps that sword is among them.\nWhere is he now? Hmm. There\u8166s a\npink mermaid in a room to the north.\nTry asking her.\x00
0x442: This is the mermaid village of Seahold.\n\n\nA strange man carrying a halberd\narrived not long ago.\n\nApparently he\u8166s looking for a sword of\nmatchless power.\n\nSince our village is connected to the\nsea, all sorts of things wash up here.\nPerhaps that sword is among them.\nWhere is he now? Hmm. If you head\nnorth, you\u8166ll find a place with several\npillars standing in a diagonal row.\nThere should be a darling blue mermaid\nthere. Try asking her.\x00
0x443: Welcome to Seahold, village of\nmermaids! Stay as long as you like!\x00
0x444: A strange man with a halberd? Yeah,\nI know who you\u8166re talking about. He\nstands out, you know?\nHead outside and go south. You should\nfind a pink mermaid in a big room down\nthere. She oughta know where he is!\nShe\u8166s my little sister, so be nice, you\nhear?\x00
0x445: I\u8166m off to play at the water\u8166s edge!\nYou should come, too!\x00
0x446: There\u8166s this spot to the north with a\nbunch of pillars lined up in a diagonal\nsort of row, right?\nWell, I was over there chatting with a\nfriend, and rather enjoying myself, I\nmight add.\nThen, all of a sudden, a man with a\nhalberd appeared out of nowhere!\n\nHe asked my friend something, but I\ncan\u8166t recall what it was...\n\nI\u8166ll bet she\u8166s there today, too, if you\nwant to talk to her. She\u8166s a cute, blue\nmermaid. You can\u8166t miss her!\x00
0x447: A suspicious-looking man? He was here!\nI saw him!\n\nWhen I said I hadn\u8166t seen what he was\nlooking for, he looked really broken up\nabout it.\nI felt so bad for him that I told him\nabout all the stuff that washes up at\nthe open area in the middle of town.\nThen he just ran off, happy as can be!\x00
0x448: That big fellow is gone. Too bad...\nI wanted to be friends.\x00
0x449: So here I was, talking with my friend,\nwhen this guy with a halberd comes out\nof nowhere.\n\u8168The legendary sword! Where is it?\u8168\nhe asks us. Well, I don\u8166t know where\nany legendary sword is.\nSo I tell him that a lot of stuff washes\nup at the open area in the middle of\ntown, and off he runs.\nThere\u8166s a mermaid who tidies up all the\nthings that collect there. She\u8166s\nprobably over there right now.\nTry asking her if she knows anything,\nokay?\x00
0x44a: If it\u8166s that suspicious fella you\u8166re\nafter, he was right over there until a\nlittle while ago.\nI don\u8166t think he found what he was\nlooking for, because he ran off right\naway.\nHe was heading south, so I\u8166ll bet you\ncan find him down that way.\n\nThere\u8166s a pink mermaid in a room down\nthere. Talk to her. She might know\nmore!\x00
0x44b: A weird fella with a big halberd?\n\n\nHe picked something up and left. It\nlooked like he was heading out of the\nvillage.\nHe was going on about how he\u8166d found\nthe ultimate sword, or something like\nthat.\nHrm? The way out? It\u8166s in a room in the\nnortheast corner of the village.\x00
0x44c: The lapping of the waves feels so good.\nI could just take a nap right here.\x00
0x44d: I don\u8166t know if it was a legendary\nsword, but I do remember something\nthat looked like a blade.\nIt drifted down into a hollow just a\nlittle way down that narrow path over\nthere.\nAnd that\u8166s exactly what I told the\nweirdo carrying that big halberd when\nhe asked.\nI wonder if he\u8166s still searching for that\nblade.\x00
0x44e: I don\u8166t know if it contained a legendary\nsword, but a treasure chest washed up\nin a room northwest of here.\nYou can probably find out what\u8166s inside\nif you head over there!\n\nOh, a man was here earlier shouting,\n\u8168The legendary sword! Where is it?\u8168\n\nIs he a friend of yours?\x00
0x44f: A whole new batch of stuff washed up\ntoday. You never know what\u8166ll wash up\nnext. It\u8166s so exciting!\x00
0x450: It looks like a broken robot...\x00
0x451: ????: I\u8166ve finally found it! The object\nof my search\u815da weapon without peer!\n\nEh? Who\u8166s there? You\u8166re after my\nsword, aren\u8166t you!\n\nLet\u8166s see how you handle the mighty\nme! And by me, I mean Gilgamesh!!\nAnd by handle, I mean DIE!!!\x00
0x452: ????: Hahaha! I\u8166m afraid the contents\nof this chest are already in my\npossession! Ha!\nAnd thanks to you, the route of my\negress is clear!\n\nBut before I go, I think I\u8166ll test the\npower of Excalibur on, oh...YOU!\x00
0x453: ????: At long last! The ultimate\nsword...is...MINE!\n\nNow I can finally go home!\n\n\nHey! Where did YOU come from?\n\n\nOh, you mean you were looking for\nExcalibur, too?\n\nHow rude of me. I mean, the four\nof you came all this way... Of course\nI\u8166ll let you have the sword.\n...\n\n\nI\u8166d say you\u8166ve been hitting the oxyale\na bit hard if you believed THAT!\x00
0x454: Y\u8166all are messin\u8166 up our line dance\npractice! Get out of the way!\x00
0x455: One, two! One, two!\x00
0x456: There must be a bigger place where we\ncan practice...\x00
0x457: You can\u8166t stand THERE! You\u8166ll ruin the\nline!\x00
0x458: And lift, and turn, and flex...\x00
0x459: I don\u8166t believe this...! Just LOOK at the\nbackup you\u8166re causing!\x00
0x45a: Whoa. My head is really spinning...\x00
0x45b: These traditional dances are pretty\ntough.\x00
0x45c: Dancing comes from the heart, so you\nmust put your heart into your dancing!\x00
0x45d: I want to be a singing, dancing\nsuperstar!\x00
0x45e: I started dancing when I was a kid.\nI guess it\u8166s been, what, fifty years?\x00
0x45f: The stage! It calls to me, darling!\x00
0x460: Dancing is a great way to relieve\nstress!\x00
0x461: I\u8166ll bet my dancing could even charm\nmonsters. Heh heh heh.\x00
0x462: The dancing world can be really\ncutthroat!\x00
0x463: You should consider changing jobs to\nbecome a dancer!\x00
0x464: Out of my way! Out of my way!\x00
0x465: Are you new at this? I can give you\nsome lessons!\x00
0x466: Sometimes I want to forget about\neverything else and just dance!\x00
0x467: This is where I belong. Dancing means\nthe world to me!\x00
0x468: This is our rehearsal room.\x00
0x469: There\u8166s another rehearsal room next\ndoor.\x00
0x46a: Everyone seems so dedicated...\nI really have to give it my all!\x00
0x46b: This is the walking course. If you want\nto be a dancer, you have to start by\ntoning those leg muscles.\x00
0x46c: Some black magic for you?\x00
0x46d: Is it white magic you seek?\x00
0x46e: Need any weapons?\x00
