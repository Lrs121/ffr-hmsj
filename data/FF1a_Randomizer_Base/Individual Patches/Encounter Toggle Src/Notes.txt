-Routine at $6682C does the actual roll for an encounter

-Find out where options are initialized
-Text speed use a default value instead?
	-Or just use unused bits for encounter toggle...
	-Or, just write 00's at $2160C8

$1DA33C - "Message Speed"

$1DAAF8 - Message Speed option description

$35FE4 / $36076, $36092 / $360C2, $360E6 / $36112
	-Where text for the 1 2 3 4 are loaded (depends on if gray or white)
	-Remember to modify coords...


Problem: Encounter rates table data is pointed to individually from a separate pointer table
	-Maybe in new $6682C replacement, if option is set advance by 0x40 bytes in ptr table?
		-or rather by 0x40 in rate data
	-And if no enc is set, auto-fail
-Should I make steps go to 32? Why not, for normal rate can just fill out table

-At 355C0, write 03 to have only three options available
	355C8 determines spacing
